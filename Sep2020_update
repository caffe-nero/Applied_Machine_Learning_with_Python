# Not Code! - 30-SEP-2020

# Due to later releases of the libraries in the book, I kept running into problems when trying to install EgeaML. 
# I updated  the setup.py file with the latest versions of the libraries from pypi.org 
# I also updated the requirements.txt file with the same.
# Then I cloned my new (forked) repository and successfully installed EgeaML.
# I hope this is of help.
# Now I am working through the book and I am hoping nothing falls apart!
# Godspeed.
