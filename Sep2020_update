# Not Code! - 30-SEP-2020

Given: 

# Due to later releases of the libraries in the book, I kept running into problems when trying to install egeaML package. 
# After forking, I updated  the setup.py file with the latest versions of the python packages from pypi.org. 
# I also updated the requirements.txt file with the same.
# Then I cloned my new repository to a local directory \EgeaML
        git clone https://github.com/caffe-nero/Applied_Machine_Learning_with_Python.git EgeaML
and successfully installed egeaML by typing code below in my python virtual environment terminal:
        pip3 install git+https://github.com/caffe-nero/Applied_Machine_Learning_with_Python.git
# That's how I successfully installed egeaML.        
# I hope this is of help.Now I am working through the book and I am hoping nothing falls apart!
# Godspeed
